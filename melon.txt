Dear Mr. Melon,

I'm truly sorry for taking your hat. I know how much this hat means to you!
I took the hat because I was in desperate need of a costume for a fruit-themed party. I thought it was just a prop, not realizing its sentimental value to you.

I hope I have returned your hat in time... I understand if you're upset, but I hope you can forgive me for this misunderstanding.

Sincerely,
Anonymous Student
